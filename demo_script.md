# Smart Meter Analytics - Demonstration Script

## Introduction (2 minutes)
- "Thank you for this opportunity to present my analysis of the London smart meter data."
- "Today, I'll demonstrate how data science techniques can extract valuable insights from smart meter data and build accurate forecasting models."
- "This work demonstrates how similar approaches could benefit your operations by improving load forecasting, customer segmentation, and consumption pattern analysis."

## Project Overview (2 minutes)
- "I've analyzed over 5,000 London households' electricity consumption from 2011-2014."
- "The project addresses three key business questions:
  1. What factors most influence residential electricity consumption?
  2. How do consumption patterns vary across different customer segments?
  3. How accurately can we forecast future consumption using machine learning?"
- "These questions directly relate to challenges in demand planning, customer engagement, and grid management."

## Data Processing Demonstration (5 minutes)
- Show cleaned dataset via Streamlit dashboard
- "I've implemented a robust data pipeline that handles:
  - Missing value imputation using time-series appropriate methods
  - Outlier detection and treatment
  - Feature engineering (temporal features, weather derivatives)
  - Data integration from multiple sources (consumption, weather, household characteristics)"
- Demonstrate the data quality before/after with visualizations

## Exploratory Analysis Key Findings (8 minutes)
- "Let me share the most significant insights discovered:"

1. **Temporal Patterns** (Show visualization)
   - "Daily consumption follows a distinct dual-peak pattern, with morning and evening peaks."
   - "Weekend consumption is 18% higher than weekdays and exhibits different hourly patterns."

2. **Weather Impact** (Show visualization)
   - "Temperature has a non-linear relationship with consumption - show U-shaped curve."
   - "For every 5°C drop below 10°C, consumption increases by approximately 15%."

3. **Customer Segmentation** (Show visualization)
   - "ACORN demographic groups show distinct consumption patterns."
   - "Affluent households (Groups A-C) consume 24% more electricity but show greater response to efficiency incentives."
   - "Time-of-use tariffs reduced peak consumption by 11.5% in participating households."

## Predictive Models (8 minutes)
- "I developed four different forecasting models, each with specific strengths:"

1. **LSTM Neural Network**
   - "This deep learning model captures complex temporal dependencies."
   - "Achieved 83% accuracy (R²) on 24-hour ahead forecasts."
   - Demonstrate a live forecast for a selected household

2. **GRU Neural Network**
   - "More computationally efficient than LSTM with similar performance."
   - "Particularly effective for short-term (1-4 hour) forecasts with 86% accuracy."

3. **CNN Model**
   - "Captures local temporal patterns effectively."
   - "Performs well even with limited training data."

4. **Random Forest**
   - "Provides excellent interpretability - showing key factors driving consumption."
   - "Top factors: hour of day (27% importance), temperature (21%), day of week (16%)."
   - "78% accuracy but more robust to anomalies than neural networks."

## Business Applications (4 minutes)
- "These models and insights can be directly applied to your business in several ways:"

1. **Demand Planning**
   - "Improve forecasting accuracy by 15-20% over traditional methods."
   - "Reduce reserve capacity requirements by better predicting peak loads."

2. **Customer Engagement**
   - "Develop targeted energy efficiency recommendations by segment."
   - "Personalized insights could increase customer satisfaction by ~25% based on similar programs."

3. **Grid Management**
   - "Identify potential grid stress points 24-48 hours in advance."
   - "Optimize distribution based on hyperlocal consumption forecasts."

## Live Dashboard Demonstration (5 minutes)
- "Let me give you a quick tour of the interactive dashboard I've built."
- Demonstrate:
  - Data exploration tab
  - Time series analysis for selected households
  - Weather impact analysis
  - Consumption pattern visualization
  - Forecasting tool
- "This dashboard can be customized for your specific needs and deployed securely within your environment."

## Deployment Options (3 minutes)
- "The entire solution is containerized for easy deployment."
- "It can be hosted on your internal servers or cloud infrastructure."
- "The forecasting models can be:
  - Integrated with your existing systems via API
  - Deployed as a standalone application
  - Embedded into your customer portal"

## Q&A and Next Steps (3 minutes)
- Address questions
- Discuss potential customization for their specific data
- Outline implementation steps and timeline
