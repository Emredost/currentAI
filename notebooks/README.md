# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.

## Notebook Categories

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- `eda_1.ipynb`: Initial data exploration and basic statistics
- `eda_2.ipynb`: Advanced data exploration and visualization

### Data Preprocessing

- `preprocess_1.ipynb`: Data cleaning, formatting, and feature preparation

### Feature Engineering

- `feature_1.ipynb`: Feature creation, selection, and importance analysis

### Model Development

- `result_1.ipynb`: Model training, evaluation, and comparison

## Visualization Outputs

This directory also contains visualization outputs generated from the notebooks:

- `model_performance.png`: Comparison of model performance metrics
- `Avg_24hr_Load_Profile_All_Meters.png`: Average daily electricity load profile
- `Aggregate Household load 2012-2014.png`: Aggregate load over the full time period
- Other visualizations generated during analysis

## Using the Notebooks

1. Start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook in the project root directory
2. Navigate to the notebooks directory
3. Open the desired notebook

Note: These notebooks may refer to paths relative to the project root, so ensure you're running them from the correct directory context.
