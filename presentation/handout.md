# Smart Meter Analytics: Powering Electricity Insights

## Project Overview
Analysis of 5,000+ London households (2011-2014) using smart meter data, weather information, and demographic details to discover consumption patterns and build accurate forecasting models.

## Key Insights

### Consumption Patterns
- **Daily**: Dual-peak pattern (7-9am, 6-8pm)
- **Weekly**: Weekend consumption 18% higher than weekdays
- **Seasonal**: Winter consumption 31% higher than summer
- **Demographic**: Affluent households consume 24% more but respond better to efficiency initiatives

### Primary Influencing Factors
1. Hour of day (27%) - Reflecting daily routines
2. Temperature (21%) - Particularly heating needs
3. Day of week (16%) - Weekend vs. weekday behaviors
4. Household type (12%) - Size and demographic impact
5. Season (9%) - Seasonal lighting and activity changes

## Forecasting Capabilities

| Model | Accuracy (RÂ²) | Best Use Case |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| LSTM Neural Network | 83% | 24-hour forecasting |
| GRU Neural Network | 82% | Short-term forecasting (1-4 hours) |
| CNN | 80% | Pattern detection with limited data |
| Random Forest | 78% | Interpretable predictions |

## Business Applications

| Area | Application | Expected Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Demand Planning | Improved load forecasting accuracy | 15-20% reduction in forecasting error |
| Customer Engagement | Personalized efficiency recommendations | 25% increase in program engagement |
| Grid Management | Early stress prediction | 24-48 hours advance warning |
| Energy Efficiency | Targeted efficiency programs | 8-12% consumption reduction |

## Implementation Options
- **Containerized Application**: Easy deployment on any infrastructure
- **API Integration**: Connect with existing systems
- **White-labeled Dashboard**: Customer-facing or internal use
- **Automated Retraining**: Continuously improving forecasts

## Next Steps
1. Pilot implementation with select customer segments
2. Integration with your customer data
3. Customization of models and dashboard
4. Full deployment and continuous improvement
