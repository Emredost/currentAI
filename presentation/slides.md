# Smart Meter Analytics
## Extracting Insights & Building Forecasts from Residential Electricity Data

---

## About This Project

- Analysis of 5,000+ London households (2011-2014)
- Integration of smart meter data with weather and demographic information
- Focus on consumption patterns, influencing factors, and forecasting
- End-to-end data science pipeline with production-ready implementation

---

## Key Business Questions

1. What factors most significantly influence residential electricity consumption?
2. How do consumption patterns vary across different customer segments?
3. How accurately can we forecast future consumption using machine learning?

## Data Processing Pipeline

![Data Pipeline](images/data_pipeline.png)

- **Sources**: Smart meter readings (30-min intervals), weather data, household demographics
- **Cleaning**: Missing value imputation, outlier detection & removal
- **Feature Engineering**: Temporal features, weather derivatives, household categorization
- **Integration**: Unified analysis dataset with 20+ features

---

## Data Quality Improvements

| Metric | Raw Data | Processed Data |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Missing Values | 14.2% | <0.1% |
| Outliers | 3.8% | <0.5% |
| Inconsistencies | 5.3% | <0.2% |
| Feature Count | 8 | 24 |

## Key Findings: Temporal Patterns

![Temporal Patterns](images/temporal_patterns.png)

- **Daily**: Distinct dual-peak pattern (morning & evening)
- **Weekly**: Weekend consumption 18% higher than weekdays
- **Seasonal**: Winter consumption 31% higher than summer

---

## Key Findings: Weather Impact

![Weather Impact](images/weather_impact.png)

- U-shaped relationship between temperature and consumption
- Every 5°C drop below 10°C increases consumption by ~15%
- High humidity increases consumption by 7-9% in summer months

---

## Key Findings: Customer Segmentation

![Customer Segmentation](images/customer_segmentation.png)

- Affluent households consume 24% more electricity
- Time-of-use tariffs reduced peak consumption by 11.5%
- Household size is the strongest demographic predictor

## Predictive Models

Four complementary approaches:

1. **LSTM Neural Network** - 83% accuracy (R²)
2. **GRU Neural Network** - Similar performance, more efficient
3. **CNN Model** - Effective with limited training data
4. **Random Forest** - 78% accuracy, excellent interpretability

## Model Performance Comparison

| Model | RMSE | MAE | R² |
|-------|------|-----|---|
| LSTM | 0.114 | 0.087 | 0.83 |
| GRU | 0.118 | 0.089 | 0.82 |
| CNN | 0.125 | 0.093 | 0.80 |
| Random Forest | 0.132 | 0.097 | 0.78 |
